# Tasklist

## Features
- Link thumbnails
- User permissions
- User profile page
    - Public/private and if profile private hide user from follower lists?
    - Profile tab (bio, like/follower count, registration date)
    - Followers tab: list followers
- List users favourite categories somewhere
- Thread search


## Technical
- Unify code, single/double quotation marks etc
- Check that user can't access features when they lack permissions
- Make sure display_name is shown instead of username
- Form input validation, check for whitespace
- Better error handling via flash messages
- Project file structure cleanup
- DB indexing
- Likes/comments db count with aggregate instead of subquery
- Combine index and category templates?
- Possibly change reply_like route, thread_id seems so unnecessary
- Display weeks/months instead of days for submission age?

## Style
- Go through css classes and combine them if possible
- Transitions
